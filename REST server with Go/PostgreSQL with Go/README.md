# Introduction

If youâ€™re a modern web developer, it is inevitable to ignore a database for long as it plays an important part in the application.

So in this post, Iâ€™ll be demonstrating how we can connect to a PostgreSQL database and perform basic SQL statements using Go.

# Prerequisites

You'll need [Go version 1.16+](https://golang.org/dl/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your development machine.

> In order to connect with PostgreSQL we need driver, So we'll use [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) as our driver.

# Code time ðŸš€

## Code _v0.1_ ðŸŒŽ

#### Aim

_Let's Start with a simple "Hello World.!" code._

Letâ€™s create a new `main.go` file. Within this, weâ€™ll import a few packages and set up a simple connection to an already running local database. for this tutorial, I'm using `postgres` as username, `123` as password, `localhost` network address, `:5432` default port, and `test` database.

You can change according to your setup.

```
postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]
```

Now open `main.go` and write the following code.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/jackc/pgx/v4"
)

func main() {

    // Open up our database connection.
	conn, _ := pgx.Connect(context.Background(),
            "postgres://postgres:123@localhost:5432/test")

    // defer the close till after the main function has finished
    // executing
	defer conn.Close(context.Background())
	var greeting string
    //
	conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), "select 'Hello, world!'").Scan(&greeting)
	fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```

`pgx.Connec()` establishes a connection with a PostgreSQL server with a connection string, this will return `pgx.Conn` is a PostgreSQL connection handle.

`conn.QueryRow()` executes sql query on the database, After that we store the response of data using `.Scan()`

## Code v1.0

So, now that weâ€™ve successfully created a connection and build hello world with the database. Now let's start with a table and perform some queries over it.

#### Aim

Now we build a program where we can insert and fetch user data. We will understand various functions in the pgx package.

### Creating Table into PostgreSQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS USERS(
        ID          SERIAL   PRIMARY KEY,
        USERNAME    VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE
    );
```

Table name is `Users` with _ID_ and _USERNAME_ columns.

### Creating user struct

```go
// User is the model present in the database
type User struct {
	ID       int    `json:"id"`
	UserName string `json:"username"`
}
```

### Inserting User into database

So if we want to store a user into the database.

```go
//Creating temporary user object.
tmpUser := User{UserName: "Captain K"}
//Calling InsertUser Method
InsertUser(&tmpUser, conn)

func InsertUser(u *User, conn *pgx.Conn) {
	// Executing SQL query for insertion
	if _, err := conn.Exec(context.Background(), "INSERT INTO USERS(USERNAME) VALUES($1)", u.UserName); err != nil {
		// Handling error, if occur
		fmt.Println("Unable to insert due to: ", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Insertion Succesfull")
}
```

### Querying Multiple Rows

When we want to read all the users stored in the database.

```go
func GetAllUsers(conn *pgx.Conn) {
	// Execute the query
	if rows, err := conn.Query(context.Background(), "SELECT * FROM USERS"); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Unable to insert due to: ", err)
		return
	} else {
		// carefully deferring Queries closing
		defer rows.Close()

		// Using tmp variable for reading
		var tmp User

		// Next prepares the next row for reading.
		for rows.Next() {
			// Scan reads the values from the current row into tmp
			rows.Scan(&tmp.ID, &tmp.UserName)
			fmt.Printf("%+v\n", tmp)
		}
		if rows.Err() != nil {
			// if any error occurred while reading rows.
			fmt.Println("Error will reading user table: ", err)
			return
		}
	}
}
```

### Querying a Single Row

Find a user using user's ID.

```go
func GetAnUser(id int, conn *pgx.Conn) {
	// variable to store username
	var username string

	// Executing query for single row
	if err := conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), "SELECT USERNAME WHERE ID=$1", id).Scan(&username); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error occur while finding user: ", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("User with id=%v is %v\n", id, username)
}
```

## Conclusion ðŸŽ‰

In this post, we managed to set up a connection to a PostgreSQL and then perform some simple queries to that database and marshal the returned responses into a struct. This should hopefully give you everything you need in order to take things further and build your own Go applications on top of PostgreSQL.

It is not safe for concurrent usage. Using a connection pool to manage access to multiple database connections from multiple goroutines.
